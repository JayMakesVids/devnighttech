To find the school wi-fi password, it'll take a few steps however it is fairly easy.
These steps were found by DevNight#8290 on Discord, aka the maker of this site.
You can use this to login to the school wi-fi on your phone for free internet service. Don't get caught though!


1 - On your school chromebook, go to chrome://sync-internals
2 - On that page, on the top, click the Search button.
3 - In the text box where it says "Search Sync Data", you're going to want to type "wifi" without the quotations.
4 - You will find a lot of numbers and letters that might be confusing, but don't worry, these all mean something.
5 - Go to this website: https://convertstring.com/EncodeDecode/HexEncode
 - You're going to want to type the name of the school Wi-Fi, exact capatalization and letter spelling. Then, press the "Hex Encode!" button.
6 - Whatever string comes out on the bottom, copy that.
7 - Go back to chrome://sync-internals, you're going to want to press CTRL + F and paste the string of letters & numbers you copied.
8 - Find the highlighted content, and click it.
9 - In that code on the right side, where it says "passphrase":, copy WHATEVER is in those quotations. That is your password. BUT DON'T LEAVE YET.

The password you copied is encoded in base64, so to get the true password, we must decode it. Follow these steps to decode it.

1 - Go to this website: https://www.base64decode.org/
2 - Paste the string that you copied in the passphrase.
3 - Press " < DECODE >" button.

Whatever the result is, is your true password!


-- NOTE -- IF YOU HAVE NOT CONNECTED TO THE WI-FI DURING YOUR CHROMEBOOK SESSION THEN IT WILL NOT SHOW UP IN CHROME://SYNC-INTERNALS. TO GET IT TO SHOW UP, MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE CONNECTED TO THE SCHOOL WIFI TO SHOW.
